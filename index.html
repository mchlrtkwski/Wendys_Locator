          This website was designed to help hungry individuals discover the nectar of life: Wendys. This webapp uses Google Maps API and Google Places API to locate neighboring Wendy restuarants in the area. By taking advantage of the icon system used by google maps, I was able to custom select an icon. This makes the map for meaningful at first glance. The document for the API can be found with Google's Forums. To use the Google Places API, one must obtain a key from Google. This API call required soley Javascript.
